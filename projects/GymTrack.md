# Development logbook

### Tue 8 Aug - 22 pm
So, I'm REALLY struggling with state management. I'm used to Redux, but for this project, I decided to use Context API, since it's been a while since I used it. Jesus Christ! I miss RTK hahaha. I'm starting to think I sould've just used Redux Toolkit in the first place, but then I set my mind that if I'm unconfortable, I'm learning and growing, so it's worth it. 
Anyways, I missed programming like this, with a project that excites me! Side projects are awesome, and it's funny 'cause the project motivates me in the gym, and the gym motivates me to finish the project! haha

Now, tech stuff:

I started just building the Context and using some states inherent to the Context file. It caused LOTS of problems, and honestly, I need to dive deeper to understand why. It simply wasn't updating the state when I needed it to and vice-versa. 
Then, today, I decided to use `useReducer` and a custom hook to handle the `RegisterWorkoutRecord` logic and it's so much better! It's probably not the best approach, but I wanted to explore things, so I'll just let it that way.
I'm STILL on the second screen. That register part is taking longer than I thought it would be, which only makes me humble 'cause I'm realizing how much I still gotta learn and study.

I'm happier tonight than I was yesterday, so I'll take that. Lots of work tomorrow, gotta prioritize what to build now and faster things up. LESGO ðŸ”¥
